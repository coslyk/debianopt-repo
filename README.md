## FAQ

#### Is it safe to use this repository?

It is safe to your Debian system. We use strict [packaging rules](https://github.com/coslyk/debianopt-repo/wiki/Packaging-rules) to ensure that the packages don't break the dependencies in the Debian's official repository, so installing packages from here won't affect softwares you've installed on your system.

However, since packages here are built automatically and not tested by human, the functionality of programs is not guaranteed. If you meet errors when launching the program, please submit an issue.

## For Developer: How to publish

Packages are maintained automatically using scripts. You only need to write a YAML config file. Please see [Wiki](https://github.com/coslyk/debianopt-repo/wiki) for details.
